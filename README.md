# Finger_Counter
Tracking the hand and calulating number of fingers open of the hand


Using OpenCV and mediapipe, live hand tracking can be achieved and we can also display the number of open fingers. 
This data can further be used to control of toggle the state of some sensors.
Example: A robotic arm can be created and programmed to move the fingers in the same way as we do by live tracking.
