# Finger_Counter
Tracking the hand and calulating number of fingers open of the hand

Using OpenCV and mediapipe, live hand tracking can be achieved and we can also display the number of open fingers. 
This data can further be used to control of toggle the state of some sensors.
Example: A robotic arm can be created and programmed to move the fingers in the same way as we do by live tracking.

You need to install cv2, mediapipe, time and serial libraries for this project

Save both the HandTrackingModule and FingerCounter files and run the FingerCounter file for the same output as mine.
HandTrackingMin can be used just for the purpose of tracking the hand, and one can modify it, according to his/her output needs.
